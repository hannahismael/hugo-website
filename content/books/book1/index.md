#### Description

As global interest in AI governance intensifies, various multilateral bodies have initiated competing frameworks, summits, and regulatory agendas. Recognizing the growing importance of these initiatives—similar to how SDGs have driven global investments—I contributed to the development of a tiered global AI policy strategy aimed at steering global priorities toward openness and public-interest AI. This was apart of my work at Mozilla Foundation.

#### Some Questions I explored:

- How can multilateral and multistakeholder governance models be leveraged to promote open-source AI and public-interest technology on a global scale, given the differing preferences of Western nations (favoring multistakeholderism) and developing countries (favoring multilateral fora)?

- In what ways can regional anxieties—such as the EU’s focus on digital sovereignty and regulatory exportation, and the US’s emphasis on national security and innovation dominance—be aligned with broader global AI governance frameworks to ensure cohesive international policy development?

- What strategies can be employed to optimize influence and legitimacy within multilateral fora, particularly when navigating tensions around input legitimacy (formal decision-making processes) versus outcome legitimacy (demonstrated ability to achieve stated goals) in the evolving AI governance landscape?
