##### Abstract

Secrecy is a feature, not a bug, for generative AI models. We explore this as a regime of successive interrelations that involves i. economic incentives towards secrecy based on high resource costs; ii. legal protections through intellectual property and the doctrine of trade secrets; and iii. policy concerns around public interest and tensions with technological innovation. A clear example of this regime at work can be seen in recent EU AI regulations, which seek to both promote transparency ideals whilst protecting trade secrecy. A proposed solution is global investment into open source AI, though such investment would need to be made across multiple layers of the generative AI model stack.
